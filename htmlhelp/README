README for the HTML Help DocBook Stylesheet
===========================================

This is simple stylesheet which can be used to generate source files
for HTML Help. HTML Help is format which is used by newer Windows
applications and by Windows operating system itself. It allows you to
pack set of HTML files and images into one file and attach TOC, index
and fulltext search capability to it. More informations about HTML
Help format and HTML Help Workshop tool can be found at
http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/tools/htmlhelp/chm/hh1start.htm.

This stylesheet is based on the XSL DocBook Stylesheet distribution
(especially on JavaHelp code) from Norman Walsh. 

This stylesheet imports chunk.xsl, thus set of HTML files is created
in usual way. Additionally is created file htmlhelp.hhp which is
project file for HTML Help Compiler and toc.hhc which holds structure
of your document. Language identifier of HTML Help is taken from the
top most element in your DocBook source. This is perfectly legal for
documents in only one language. If language is not set, US English is
defaulted. There is one problem - MS language codes are country
sensitive, and this information is not available in DocBook source. If
stylesheet selects bad code for you, edit langcodes.xml file, and
remove all entries which have yours language code, but are located in
inappropriate country.

Title of whole HTML Help is taken from first title element in
document.  Fulltext searching is automatically on. If your document
contains index terms, they are automatically converted to ActiveX,
which is recognized by HTML Help compiler.

If you are generating HTML Help for non-Western Europe languages, you should
change output encoding of your files, because HTML Help compiler improperly 
handles UTF-8 and even character entities in TOC file and index entries. 
This can be easily done by "driver" file like this:

<xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
		version="1.0">
   <xsl:output encoding="windows-1250"/>
   <xsl:import href="<path to file.../contrib/htmlhelp/docbook.xsl...>"/>
</xsl:stylesheet>

Currently only XT processor is supported, support for other processors
may be added in the future.
